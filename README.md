# CCA_tutorial
 Tutorial for brain-cognition CCA by Bethany Little (bethany.little@ncl.ac.uk). 

The tutorial uses a publically available dataset of healthy adults (available at https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds004215/versions/1.0.2). This is used as 'dummy' data and has not been cleaned or pre-processed. 

Please note that if you use this code for your own data, the script assumes that the data has been cleaned (i.e., any skewed distributions and outliers have been dealt with). There are some suggestions of how to check the data in the script. Any pre-processing of the data should also be done before running the CCA_tutorial.R script, for example, accounting for confounding variables and z-scoring.
